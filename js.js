//consider storing the contents of the board in an array. Can you represent the winning combinations in another array? You could then check if any of the winning combinations are on the board after every move.

  //above makes sense x = 1, o = 2, []

  //a cell should not be able to be played once it has been marked
  //refresh button to reset once someone wins? or time limit -->

  //keep a tally of who has won how many times
